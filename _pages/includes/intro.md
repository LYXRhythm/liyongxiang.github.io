Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a PhD candidate at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University <img src='./images/scu.png' style='width: 6em;'>, China, under the supervision of Professor [Dezhong Peng (彭德中)](https://dblp.org/pid/17/6253.html) and Professor [Peng Hu (胡鹏)](https://penghu-cs.github.io/). Our research team focuses on enhancing the robustness and adaptability of multimodal retrieval, recognition, and other systems to meet the challenges of real-world deployment and applications.

My research primarily revolves around machine learning and optimization. I am particularly interested in topics such as multimodal learning, domain generalization, foundation models, and other emerging fields in AI and machine learning. Through my work, I aim to improve the scalability, effectiveness, and robustness of models and systems, ensuring their adaptability across diverse environments and tasks.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in cutting-edge engineering application aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications.
